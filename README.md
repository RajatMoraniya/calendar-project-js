# calendar-project-js

In this javascript major Project I have created Calendar which is used to check date using Html, CSS and Javascript functionality. I have used basic html tag and some CSS property to decorate calender. In javascript I have used querrySelector to select html element to perform operation. and in javascript I have used Date objects, and other functions.
